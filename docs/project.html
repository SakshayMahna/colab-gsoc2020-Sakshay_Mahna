JdeRobot’s Robotics-Academy is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises using Python language where the student has to code the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision.

This project is under JdeRobot Robotics-Academy. The idea for this project is to introduce Evolutionary Robotics into Robotics-Academy developing exercises with mobile robots. Implementing Neural Networks and their related exercises are the main goals of the exercise.
