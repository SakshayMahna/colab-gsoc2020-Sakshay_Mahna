# Obstacle Avoidance

## Goal
The goal of this exercise is to make the robot learn obstacle avoidance behaviour by means of a Neural Network adjusting it's parameters using Genetic Algorithms

## Installation
Follow the instruction in this [README](./../README.md)

## How to run your solution?

- Source the environment variables

```bash
source /opt/jderobot/setup.bash
source /opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/gazebo-setup.sh
source /opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/assets-setup.sh
```

- Launch the Gazebo simulation in the same terminal window. A new window showing the Robot Model in an environment would appear. Ignore the yellow colored warnings that appear in the terminal.

```bash
roslaunch ./launch/obstacle_avoidance.launch
```

- In a new terminal window, execute the academic application that will incorporate your code. This would open a GUI application through which the user can execute the code.

```bash
python2 ./exercise.py
```
