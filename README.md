### Week #1
**Expected Outcome**: Implement a Neural Network module. The module would contain Static Neural Network and Dynamic Neural Network classes.

**Expected Problems**: Time! and the visual depiction of the Neural Networks.

### Week #2
**Expected Outcome**: Make some changes to the code, add proper documentation, tests and examples.

**Expected Problems**: Never worked on documentation before. So, something new to work on!

### Week #3
**Expected Outcome**: Properly generate the Neural Network Morphology

**Expected Problems**: The higher level functions of the construction, simplified for the user
